<h2>My Top 3 Best Movies Of 2024</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>I will not lie. Probably one of the siliest series ever. I really wanted to see Galalthria become queen.</p>
<h3>The Witcher</h3>
<p>I have not finished this series yet. I have wifi issues but no biggy. It is the best. Except for the destiny bullshit.</p>
<h3>The Passion Of The Christ</h3>
<p>The scariest and most painful movie I have ever watched. I still ask myself how my Lord went through all that pain and still carried on. He never gave up on us , he knew that the will of God must be done. The pain he endured. The insults he endured were not enough yet from everyone. But in all that he never gave up. He knew his fate yet kept on going. Praise God!!</p>
